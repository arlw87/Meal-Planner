### Planner

When the user selects the calendar icon in the main menu, they will go to the planner section of the program, where the sub menu (grey bar) will allow them to choose between Calendar, Shopping List and Cupboard options.

#### Calendar

![calendar](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/calendar.jpg?raw=true)

The Calendar section of the meal planner application allows the user to plan what meals they have for the week ahead. The calendar shows 7 days, Monday to Sunday, in a list format. For each day the user can set up to three meals: Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. 

When the user clicks on a day in the list, they can then select what meal that want for breakfast by selecting a meal from the drop down box in the breakfast section, if they click update then that meal will then be set for that day and will be reflected in the calendar list. The same is true for selecting lunch and dinner for that day. If the user wants to change the meal they choosen they can simply choose another and click update to override it. If they want to delete it, they can click on the rubbish bin icon next to the update button.

![calendar2](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/calendar2.jpg?raw=true)

Users can then select another day in the calendar list and select and update the meals for that day.

The nutritional information of the meal that is selected will be displayed below the drop down list box and the combined nutritional information for all meals of that day is detailed in the daily nutritional information section.  

Once the user has completed their meal plan for the week they can then click on the ‘Generate Shopping List’ button to produce a shopping list of all the ingredients for the meals they have planned for, the application will then show the user their shopping list in the shopping list section. If the user wants to remove items from the shopping list they already have in the cupboard (See Cupboard section) then they can click the ‘Exclude Cupboard Stores’ checkbox before clicking ‘Generate Shopping List’.

If the user wants to clear the whole calendar they can click ‘Clear Planner’ and confirm that they want to clear the whole planner via a dialog box.

![calendarClearConfirm](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/calendarClearConfirm.jpg?raw=true)

#### Shopping List

When the user fills out some or all of the calendar planner and clicks ‘Generate Shopping List’ the application will gather all the ingredients and their quantities from the meals in the planner and create a shopping list for those meals. If one ingredient occurs in multiple meals, then their quantities are combined and the ingredient is only shown once in the list.

![shoppingList](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/shoppingList.jpg?raw=true)

The date and time the shopping list was generated is displayed above the list. If after the shopping list has been generated the user edits the calendar in anyway, or either the shopping list or the calendar is cleared a warning message will be displayed next to the shopping list to notify the user that the shopping list may not reflect the ingredients of the meals in the current calendar. If the user wants to ensure the shopping list matches the current calendar view, they simply have to click ‘Generate Shopping List’ in the calendar section of the program again. 

![shoppingList2](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/shoppingList2.jpg?raw=true)

The user can export the shopping list as a text file by clicking on the ‘Export’ button. 

![shoppingListExport](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/shoppingListExport.jpg?raw=true)

They are presented with a ‘Save Shopping List’ window where they can select the location and name the text file to save.

The user can also clear the shopping list by clicking the ‘Clear List’ button. They will be asked for confirmation below the list is cleared.

![shoppingListClear](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/shoppingListClear.jpg?raw=true)

#### Cupboard

![Cupboard](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/cupboard.jpg?raw=true)

The cupboard sub section of the planner section is used to specify what ingredients the user already has in their stores. The user can choose to take account of this when they are generating the shopping list or not. If they do then if an ingredient on the shopping list is already in the cupboard then:

-	If there is a greater quantity of the ingredient in the cupboard than in the shopping list, then the item is removed from the shopping list
-	If there is a lesser quantity of the ingredient in the cupboard than is required for the shopping list then, the amount of the ingredient in the cupboard is removed from the amount of the ingredient in the shopping list, but the item will remain on the shopping list

Note, the ingredient quantities in the Cupboard will not be reduced when the shopping list is generated.

The interface of the Cupboard sub section is similar too part of the Add Meal interface. The user can select the ingredient that they have in their cupboard stores from the list of all ingredients on the left, they can also use the search ingredient text field to filter the list for ease of use.  

![CupboardSearch](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/cupboardSearch.jpg?raw=true)

Once the user selects the ingredient to add they must add a quantity either in grams or in portions for example a Tin and click the ‘Add’ button to include it into the Ingredients in Cupboard list. If a user wants to remove an ingredient from the Ingredients in Cupboard list they need to select the ingredient and click the ‘Remove’ button. 

The user can also clear the entire list of Ingredients in Cupboard by clicking the ‘Clear Cupboard’ button, if they do this they will be asked to confirm their choice. 

If an error is made when adding or removing an ingredient from the Ingredients in Cupboard list then they are notified via a dialog box. 

![CupboardError](https://github.com/arlw87/Meal-Planner/blob/master/ReadMe-Images/cupboardError.jpg?raw=true)

## Other Information

The application saves the state of meal planner calendar list, the shopping list, the cupboard ingredients list and various settings, every time they are updated, in external files. The user can therefore close the application and know that when the application is opened again the program will be in the same state it was before it was closed.
